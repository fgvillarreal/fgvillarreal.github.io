Hi, my name is Francisco G. Villarreal.

I currently work as an Economic Affairs Officer at [UN ECLAC´s](https://www.cepal.org/en) Economic Development Division, focusing on financing for development issues.   

Previously, I worked at UN ECLAC´s Subregional Headquarters in Mexico City and the Economic Projections Centre in Santiago. Before joining the UN, I worked in the Applied Mathematics Research Programme at the [Mexican Petroleum Institute](https://www.gob.mx/imp), and in the treasury at [Banamex](https://www.banamex.com/).

I have a PhD. in Public Policy from the Tecnológico de Monterrey´s [School of Government](https://escueladegobierno.itesm.mx/), as well as an MSc. in Economics and Finance, and a Diploma in Economics from the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).

My research interests focus on the relationship(s) between micro level heterogeneity, macro level fluctuations and public policies shaping them.
